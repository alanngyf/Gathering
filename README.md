# Gathering 
## An application I built during the time in Coding Dojo.

Create a Rails application wherein a user can create/edit/delete and join events. The logged user can also put comments on the the discussion board per event.

### Required Features:

* Registration and Login with validation.
* Display of events separated by the state to where the event will be held (the first table displays the events under the same * * state to where the logged user is location; the second displays the events to be held on other states).
* Update of the Action/Status portion of each event entry.
* Ability to join and event; cancel the participation to the event or edit/delete event created by the user.
* Display of attendees per event and discussion board per event.
* Logout feature.
